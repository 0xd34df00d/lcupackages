 <long>&lt;i>Renkoo&lt;/i> has a cool fading effect with each incoming message. It also includes smooth scrolling. This however may be slow. So &lt;i>Renkoo Naked&lt;/i> was born to bring the beautiful message style some needed speed. It has all of the color combos and everything you like about &lt;i>Renkoo&lt;/i>, minus the fading and smooth scroll features. This theme is available at &lt;a href="http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&amp;amp;xtra_id=2160">http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&amp;amp;xtra_id=2160&lt;/a>
